All your nice gear held captive in a washing machine as you sit in your reverse tidy whities because you're on your third day of reusing your undergarments. Just hoping against hope, that you have not once again shrunk your dungarees so bad. But when you walk out, everyone says, that man wearing a little girl's dungarees? Then everyone says, hey, if you shrunk your dungarees, why did you wear them out of the laundromat? Just keep the pants you wore in. But the pants you wore in, you got melted chocolate M and M's all over from the vending machine, and those pants are now too filthy to wear out because you're worried that the melted chocolate looks like a weird stain that everyone's gonna mock you for so you stuff yourself into tight jeans thinking, Maybe this is the style now. And instead everyone says, hey man. Why do you look like a cowboy, but you're wearing little girls dungarees.",

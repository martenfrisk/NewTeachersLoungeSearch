All of our listeners and my feet. Lord, I'm in. Yeah, Lauren, it's me, Moshe Epstein, Christians for Jesus Church. Um, and I wanna thank you today. I want to thank you today, Um, for everything you did get me in touch with the insurance agency after that fender bender. Um, I got rear ended in a neighborhood. Um, because I was looking for, as you know, I dio I was looking for a, um, yard sales. I go shopping three yard sales on Saturdays, and I thought I saw one, and it turned out it was just Jerrick. But I had realized that too late and got rear ended by a angry old lady who got physical with me and, you know, as a Christian for Jesus, I never would fight anyone, let alone a woman level on an old woman. But this lady tested my patients, Lord and I want to thank you for that test. Amen. Amen. Lord, uh, is may Butch. I just wanted toe. Take a little bit of time here, Teoh. Thank you so much for letting me land on my feet after I lost my position at my last church. Um, and I appreciate you making it so seemingly easy for me to get a job as the hospital chaplain at that bad hospital on for on Fourth Street. Which clarify, Lord, that C h a p l. I am. He's the Charlie Chaplin. It's kind of comic relief from the hospital. You know, he told me I could make it as religious as I'd like. And I said, thank you for the opportunity. By the time I'm done here, I will. I'll be back to being a full preacher. But, Lord, thank you so much. And if you could, uh, allow me not to get any ingrown hairs when I end up shaving my mustache to give myself a little chaplain And also Lord, please let people not call me. Uh, you're already working with the bone structure of the big Man. Big, bad man, if you know what I mean. Lord, please, just gonna look homeless immediately. Like your hand. I just asked lower that you let the satire. Be clear. Let the Santa every clear, Lord, Let me like your routine. Amen. Lord aim shares a lot with the big bad guy. Hey, Lord, it's Quentin Rush from Enterprise Baptist. I just want to thank you for all your gifts that you have given me. And, Lord, I want to hop on this Lindsay's feet. Their request. Thank you, Lord. Someone hurt me because I do feel as if my health is in compromise from my simple proximity to his feet. Because they have something. It's unclear what it is, but it feels like a new thing that could be the end of our species.",

Don't little boy. Too far to the ground. Good times crawling into the backseat of this Bronco Now coming after. Good way. That's not the direction of the court out. Where's Todd going? Jeez. Oh, God. I think Todd might have gone on the TV. There's gonna be a chase. There is one. That is a change. L a cartridge. Look at all the cars going by. There's so many cop cars. Yeah, obviously all can't see this, but we just turned on the TV. Andi there! There's time. Oh, he's waving out the window. They wanted a gun out the wind. They have a surprisingly tight shot through the window of a sees white Bronco. It's a really beautifully framed medium. Close up Todd's cinematography. Eso Skillet does say on the bottom corner, says Shot by Roger Deakins. So I guess this brothers guy school, it's like, Oh, they're cutting to a roadside shot. No going by. Wow, there's Todd Flipping the bird flipped off that camera and through a razor out dumping evidence is, Yeah, but that's not the way he wants to get rid of. Yes, So I wish everybody could sort of fall along to this because this is this is something else. We don't really know what's going on. We just know that Todd is in a white Bronco with shooting the moon. Yeah, Big Moon. There's this whole ugly that is the sexiest. But I've ever said he's How does the back way shooting a moon and also pissing little wiener backwards out his leg? It's like he's like, just peeing straight into the door. Oh my God! The headline on CNN now is man with tiny Penis peas backwards out. But he may be killed. O j It's pretty crazy. How small? The very the lead. Lately CNN, small Penis and all caps arrested a thought is barely recognizable. Yeah, this is bad. I don't know what to do. Guys, I wish we could, uh I wish we could help, but we did. We told Todd where we stand and we wow, are washing our hands of this. Killed his best friend. Oh, gee, I do too. That's really crazy, because O j has saved us our assets, but also so many. But, you know, But you got to think about the mental state Todd has been in this season. I mean, this guy has went from being on top of the world. Thinking is the best actor in the in the history of acting being like, literally shunned by an entire community replaced by Lin Manuel Miranda. But like made Lana, ma'am Well, man and and and honestly, he was hanging out with 15 year olds who who showed him how to skateboard. I mean, that's what I mean. There is a steer right. There is a straight up, perfectly drawn straight line from normal man to his first murder that you just see the progression and we've We've had it recording. See it to you in the middle of it. Yeah, I had no idea Todd was even sick. But now that I look back on it, so you know, I look back on the last clean. The last 35 episodes of this show has been sick the whole time, and I got a look at myself. This has happened to a lot of my friends when they've done something really crazy and let's be really scary, and I've gone did not see that and let me. All that's happened to all of us over again over the history of this show is a mystery. The history and that's what the show is, has a rich, rich history that is discussed. It reeks of history. It's at a it's your ripping in the morning after a long night of drinking Pistor. It's a piss story. That's what is listen. And it's a lot of that, you know, like we all. We've all been in that position where you get interviewed after one of your friends goes berserk, preserve and if reverse when the cameras turn on. What are you going to do? Of course you go. I didn't see it coming, because if you say yeah, I saw that he was capable. And what am I going to do? I'm trying to live my fucking life. You can't say that on camera. Everybody saw everything coming. It's obvious. Don't ever buy that lie. Oh, woe use that. Whose phone is that? Whose phone is that? Oh, here we go. Is that Sam Silver? Yeah. Oh, my God. It's TP No toilet paper is toilet paper. Yes, the man we wave our butts with its way owning up to your normal mike. Todd, get on the freeway. You're on surface streets.

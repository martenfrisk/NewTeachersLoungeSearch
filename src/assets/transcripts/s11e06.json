I I I I was hoping that we could sort of finally come to terms with who we are. And accept and accept who we are. You know? And that's a huge thing. And that's what I wanted to do this play because I thought that was the intention, was for me, sort of sort of learn my who I am and not feel so damn sad about myself all the time. Learn to have a little bit of self confidence, You know? And and the whole thing for me in starting a gym was to sort of work on myself and and and try to start feeling a little bit better about who I really am, And I think the first step to that is accepting the things about you that that maybe are a little unsavory or you think you're bad, which is the reason you guys sorta associate from your reflection. Wow. You're you're not happy with who you are as people, so you see who you really already say, well, that's not me.",
